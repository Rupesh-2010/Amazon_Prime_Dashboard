## 🔷 Project Summary

This project presents an interactive **Amazon Prime Video Analytics Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI**.  
The objective of this analysis is to transform raw streaming platform data into actionable business insights that help understand **content performance, audience distribution, and platform growth trends**.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly evaluate how content is distributed across genres, countries, release years, and audience ratings — helping streaming platforms make smarter content acquisition and production decisions.

This project simulates how a Data Analyst in an OTT company (like Amazon Prime Video / Netflix / Hotstar) would analyze platform content data and present it to business teams.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Streaming platforms host thousands of movies and TV shows.  
Without analysis, it becomes difficult to answer critical questions such as:

- What type of content dominates the platform?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- Is the platform movie-focused or series-focused?
- How has content growth changed over time?
- Which age-rating categories are most common?
- What genres should the platform invest in?

This dashboard converts raw catalog data into a visual decision-making tool for executives and product managers.
